The clinical data science group employs advanced statistics, machine learning and computer vision techniques in the context of clinical radiology to enable fast and precise AI-supported diagnosis and prognostication.

Our direct embedding into the Department of Radiology provides close cooperation and interdisciplinary interaction with radiologists.

This gives us the opportunity to identify and address clinical needs and to develop and evaluate AI solutions directly in the clinical context.
